## Change Process

This Specification is a free and open standard governed by the Ara Foundation. Any changes must be approved by consensus with the main editor.


## Language

The keywords “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 (see “[Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119)").


## Goals

Hyperpayment is created to define a decentralized payment system involving multiple parties, yet the participants don’t know each other without permission, affecting more than two parties. It will lead to the decentralization of the Internet.

It aims to:



* Be the internet’s payment protocol.
* Be minimalistic in terms of syntax.
* It should be trivial to make it understandable by humans and computers.
* Be expandable
* Reduce the risk of human error to as close to zero as possible.

The use cases for Hyperpayment include:



* Revenue of the open source library from the proprietary software.
* Data ownership of the user and receiving money if data analysts and AI model trainers used it.


## Specification

Hyperpayment defines a text format of how the particular parties in a domain on the internet interact. Each domain must specify the protocol that follows the hyperpayment protocol.

The protocol must specify the



* Category of the parties.
* Building that defines how participants are categorized into the categories and the hierarchy of the categories.
* The flow of money between categories is the vectors and splines. The first flow must be defined as the initial point of which category sends what. The flow section must describe the junction of the flow vectors.
* The source defines all the money. The money may be deposited, withdrawn, or transferred.
* The resources denoting the money shall be described as category and $ prefix. The flow must be based on the resources.
* Junctions must be defined using the hooks “before,” “after,” and “along.”
* Contract of each category that shall define how the money is received and how it is forwarded

The category must not have the keywords whose lemmas are:

“Ara,” “hyperpayment,” “user,” “category,” and “love.” 

This means, “usering,” “categories,” “categorize,” “ara,” “a-ra” must not be used.

The category must be defined as a single word.

Any hyperpayment protocol of any domain must be expandable. 

The resources that are going through the flow must be retained. The sum of all money that every user in all categories receives must equal the initial resource.

The expanded protocol 



* must include the web link to the protocol that it expands in the intro. 
* The expanding protocol may add new categories. 
* The expanding protocol must not change the category list defined by the parent protocol.
* The expanding protocol must not change the contract.

Here is the template that the protocols may follow:


    Title: Opensource


    Implements: Hyperpayment protocol ([Link to this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d3TgpcZGwnmzO3SXthvqX_hG5cji6Yj3oZUMvrwDm08/edit?usp=sharing))


    Authors: John Doe ([to@example.com](mailto:to@example.com))


    Intro: the open source library; if it’s used in the proprietary software, then the user must also pay for the library.


    Categories:


        * Client
        * Dependency
        * Business

    Flow:


    Resources: $client


    Flow#1 - $client from Client to Business.


    Flow#2 - $client from Client to Dependency.


    Junctions


    Flow#2 is executed before the flow#1. The flow 2 receives the remaining amount from the flow 2.


    Contracts:


    Client: is defined by the businesses. It’s the user who uses the client.


    Business: is defined by the software developer.


    The business owner defines dependency by exposing the open-source code of their software.
